Title: The Role of AI in Personalized Learning
Content: Artificial Intelligence enables adaptive learning paths by analyzing student performance data. Systems can tailor content difficulty, pacing, and modality for each learner. Key challenges include data privacy, bias mitigation, and explainability of recommendations.

Title: Formative Assessment with AI Tutors
Content: AI tutors provide instant feedback on student exercises using NLP and knowledge tracing. They identify misconceptions, suggest remedial content, and track mastery across skills. Reliability depends on high-quality datasets and clear pedagogical objectives.

Title: Ethics in Educational AI
Content: Ethical use of AI in classrooms requires transparency, accountability, and inclusivity. Governance frameworks should ensure fairness across demographics and avoid punitive surveillance. Involving teachers, parents, and students in design increases trust and adoption.

Title: Learning Analytics Dashboards
Content: Dashboards aggregate clickstreams, quiz scores, and engagement metrics to help teachers intervene early. Visual analytics highlight at-risk students and effective learning resources. Interpretability and actionability drive real-world impact.

Title: Multimodal Content for Accessibility
Content: Converting lectures into transcripts, summaries, and visual notes supports diverse learners. Speech-to-text and text-to-speech enable accessibility. Captioning and alternative text improve inclusion for students with disabilities.

Title: Open Educational Resources (OER)
Content: OER platforms provide free textbooks and lesson plans. AI helps align resources to curricula and student needs. Sustainability models include institutional support and community contributions.
